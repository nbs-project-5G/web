    <h2>What is 5G?</h2>
    <p>
      5G, short for "fifth generation," is the latest wireless technology standard that succeeds 4G LTE. It promises significantly faster speeds, ultra-low latency, and the ability to connect a massive number of devices simultaneously. It uses higher-frequency bands, advanced antenna technologies, and efficient spectrum use to enable revolutionary improvements in mobile connectivity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unlike its predecessors, 5G is not just an upgrade for smartphones. It’s a platform for innovation that enables smart cities, self-driving cars, remote surgeries, immersive virtual reality (VR), and the massive Internet of Things (IoT). With peak data rates of up to 20 Gbps and latency as low as 1 millisecond, 5G is changing how we interact with technology.
    </p>

    <h2>How Does 5G Work?</h2>
    <p>
      5G networks operate on three frequency bands: low-band (below 1 GHz), mid-band (1-6 GHz), and high-band (above 24 GHz, also known as millimeter waves). Each band offers a trade-off between speed and coverage:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Low-band:</strong> Offers wide coverage but lower speeds.</li>
      <li><strong>Mid-band:</strong> Balanced in terms of speed and coverage.</li>
      <li><strong>High-band:</strong> Extremely fast but with limited range.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      5G also uses technologies like beamforming and massive MIMO (Multiple Input Multiple Output), which allow the network to focus signals precisely and support many devices efficiently.
    </p>

    <h2>Benefits of 5G</h2>
    <p>
      5G offers numerous advantages across industries:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Faster Speeds:</strong> Download full HD movies in seconds.</li>
      <li><strong>Low Latency:</strong> Crucial for real-time apps like autonomous vehicles and remote surgeries.</li>
      <li><strong>Increased Capacity:</strong> Handle thousands of devices per square kilometer.</li>
      <li><strong>Reliability:</strong> Support critical communications for emergency services and healthcare.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Challenges of 5G</h2>
    <p>
      Despite its potential, 5G faces several hurdles:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Infrastructure Costs:</strong> Deploying small cells and antennas everywhere is expensive.</li>
      <li><strong>Limited Coverage:</strong> High-band 5G has short range and can be blocked by buildings.</li>
      <li><strong>Health Concerns:</strong> Some fear radiation exposure, though there's no scientific evidence of harm.</li>
      <li><strong>Security:</strong> More devices connected means greater risks for cyberattacks.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>The Future of 5G</h2>
    <p>
      As 5G networks become more widespread, they’ll pave the way for groundbreaking innovations:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Smart Cities:</strong> Sensors for traffic, pollution, and utilities will make cities more efficient.</li>
      <li><strong>Healthcare:</strong> Doctors will perform remote surgeries with high precision.</li>
      <li><strong>Industry 4.0:</strong> Factories will use automation, AI, and robotics for smarter production.</li>
      <li><strong>Education:</strong> Augmented reality (AR) and VR will transform how we learn and interact.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The full rollout of 5G is expected to take years, but the foundation being built today will reshape the way we live, work, and connect.
